**Air quality monitoring**

**Abstract**

Air Quality Monitoring is crucial for public health,

IoT can provide real- time data analysis and management. This

presentation will discuss a comprehensive system for enhancing

air quality monitoring.

**Comprehensive System for Real Time Data Analysis**

01\. Aquarius is one of the oldest constellations. Its name

means "water bearer," and its symbol is a representation of

water.

02\. Capricornus is the smallest constellation in the zodiac. Its

name means "horned goat" and is represented by a goat with

a fishtail.

03\. Aries is one of the zodiac constellations, and its symbol

represents the ram's horns. It's unique because its image has

changed over time.

04\. Cassiopeia is a constellation in the northern sky. It is

easily recognizable due to its distinctive 'W' shape, formed

by five bright stars.

**Defining a target**

Management of air quality data can include data

visualization, reporting, and sharing. The data can be used by

policymakers to make informed decisions on air quality

regulations and initiatives.

**Conclusion(where we are)**

Enhancing air quality monitoring through loT can

improve public health. A comprehensive system for real-time

data analysis and management can provide valuable insights

and recommendations. Let's work together to create a

healthier environment.
